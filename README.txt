This is a printable template of "code-ruled paper"; that is, paper with a grid pattern specifically formatted for writing out code (or any text, really) by hand.

This particular template uses two fonts: Liberation Mono and GnuMICR. You could really swap those out with any monospace font, though.

Enjoy!
